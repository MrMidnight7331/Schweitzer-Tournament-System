# Schweitzer-Tournament-System

Schweitzer Tournament System becuase Ann-Sophie wanted it. I got a cup of Coffee in return so nice work! 

PS. Ignore all the bugs. First rule of programming: It works so we shall not touch it again:)

# Installation

`git clone https://github.com/MrMidnight7331/Schweitzer-Tournament-System.git`

`cd Schweitzer-Tournament-System`

`pip3 -m requirements.txt`

`python3 main.py`

# Usage

Paste a wordlist of names in the initialization prompt like this: 
`name1,name2,name3,name4,name5...`
if a odd number of player is detected, a random one will be selected and put in the "Watching" spectater position. This will change after every round. If no matchups can be created, the program will close!

# Known Issues

I tried to fix it but it didn't work still:
When entering a false integer 0,1,2 or just a wrong input in general, it will just skip the matchups to the next one. Tried to fix it, it did stayed at the same matchup players but it just skipped the entire round. Send a pull request if you have a fix!
